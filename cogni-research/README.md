Multi-agent research report generator for [Claude Cowork](https://claude.ai/cowork). STORM-inspired editorial workflow with parallel section research and claims-verified review loops. Five report types (basic, detailed, deep, outline, resource) and four source modes (web, local documents, wiki, hybrid) — from quick overviews to deep recursive explorations.

## Why this exists

LLMs can research and write — but the reports they produce have real problems that undermine trust and usefulness:

| Problem | What happens | Impact |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Unverified citations | Reports cite sources confidently, but 14–95% of LLM citations are hallucinated ([GhostCite, 2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06718)) | Readers trust claims that sources don't actually support |
| Shallow outputs | Most AI research tools produce single-pass summaries from a handful of searches | Surface-level analysis that misses nuance and depth |
| No traceability | Generated reports have no audit trail from claim to source | Impossible to verify or update findings later |
| Manual effort | Deep, multi-source research reports still take days of desk research | Outdated by the time they ship |
| No quality gates | Reports go from draft to final with no systematic review | Errors, gaps, and unsupported conclusions slip through |

This plugin automates the research-heavy parts — parallel web search, source aggregation, claims verification, iterative review — while keeping strategic judgment where it belongs: with you.

## What it is

A STORM-inspired editorial research pipeline for the insight-wave ecosystem. Parallel web research agents decompose topics and gather evidence; a source curator ranks quality and diversity; a writer compiles the draft with inline citations; a structural reviewer gates quality before acceptance. Five report types — basic, detailed, deep, outline, and resource — match research intensity to the question. Upstream of cogni-narrative (narrative composition) and cogni-visual (visual enrichment); downstream of cogni-claims for source-level verification of every factual assertion.

## What it does

1. **Decompose** your topic into orthogonal sub-questions grounded by preliminary web search
2. **Research** in parallel — one agent per sub-question, searching the web and extracting findings
3. **Aggregate** sources across all sub-questions, deduplicate, and enforce quality thresholds
4. **Write** a structured report with inline citations linking every claim to its source → `research-report.md` optionally enriched into themed HTML with interactive charts and diagrams via `cogni-visual:enrich-report`, then polished by `cogni-claims` claim verification and `cogni-copywriting` copywriter
5. **Review** structurally — automated quality gate checks completeness, coherence, depth, and clarity
6. **Verify** (separate step via `verify-report`) — extract claims and check each against its source URL via cogni-claims in a dedicated context window

## What it means for you

If you produce research, analysis, or any content that needs to be both sourced and correct, this is your end-to-end pipeline.

- **Ship reports in minutes, not hours.** Basic reports dispatch 5–7 agents concurrently; deep reports run 15–25. Research that would take hours completes in minutes.
- **Verify every factual claim against its source URL.** Every claim is extracted, matched to its source URL, and checked for deviations — misquotation, unsupported conclusions, selective omission.
- **Deliver reports as themed, interactive HTML.** Reports finish with data visualizations — not just markdown. Optional PDF and DOCX export included.
- **Resume interrupted runs from the last completed phase.** Interrupted runs pick up from the first incomplete phase. No lost work.
- **Trace every finding back to a source.** Every finding links to a source, every claim links to a verification result. The full workspace is Obsidian-browsable.
- **Match research intensity to the question.** Quick overview (basic), multi-section report (detailed), recursive tree exploration (deep), structured framework (outline), or annotated bibliography (resource) — matched to your needs.

## Installation

This plugin is part of the [insight-wave monorepo](https://github.com/cogni-work/insight-wave) and is installed automatically with the marketplace.

**Prerequisites:**
- Web access enabled (for research)
- bash, python3 (stdlib only — no pip dependencies)
- **cogni-claims** plugin (recommended — enables claims-verified review loop)
- Optional: **cogni-narrative** (story arc polish), **cogni-copywriting** (executive polish), **cogni-visual** (presentation generation)

## Quick start

Describe what you want in natural language — no slash commands needed. Claude detects the request and loads the skill automatically:

- "Write a research report on quantum computing's impact on cryptography"
- "Write a detailed research report on AI adoption in healthcare"
- "Deep research on the future of autonomous vehicles"
- "Resume the research on autonomous vehicles"
- "Verify the report" (after research completes — runs `verify-report` in a fresh context)

## Try it

After installing, type one prompt:

> Research the state of AI regulation in the EU

Claude decomposes the topic, dispatches parallel web researchers, compiles a sourced report, and runs a structural review. Then run `/verify-report` to extract and verify every factual claim against its cited source — you'll see which claims check out and which don't, and the review loop will revise until quality standards are met.

## Data model

Four entity types with Dublin Core metadata, wikilink cross-references, and ISO 8601 timestamps:

| Entity | Storage | Key Fields |
|--------|---------|------------|
| `SubQuestion` | `00-sub-questions/data/sq-*.md` | query, parent_topic, section_index, status (pending → researched / failed) |
| `Context` | `01-contexts/data/ctx-*.md` | sub_question_ref, source_refs[], key_findings[], search_queries_used[] |
| `Source` | `02-sources/data/src-*.md` | url, title, fetch_method, content_hash, cited_by[] |
| `ReportClaim` | `03-report-claims/data/rc-*.md` | statement, source_ref, verification_status, deviation_type |

All entities are markdown with YAML frontmatter — Obsidian-browsable with wikilink graph navigation. See [references/data-model.md](references/data-model.md) for the full schema.

## Report types

| Type | Sub-questions | Agents | Words | Use case |
|------|--------------|--------|-------|----------|
| Basic | 5 | 7–9 | 3,000–5,000 | Quick overview, single topic |
| Detailed | 5–10 | 10–15 | 5,000–10,000 | Multi-section report with outline |
| Deep | 10–20 (tree) | 15–25 | 8,000–15,000 | Recursive exploration, maximum depth |
| Outline | 5 | 5–7 | 1,000–2,000 | Structured framework only, no prose |
| Resource | 5 | 5–7 | 1,500–3,000 | Annotated bibliography / reading list |

## How it works

The pipeline uses two skills that split the work across separate context windows:

**research-report** orchestrates six phases. Phase 0 initializes the project workspace and runs preliminary web searches to ground the research. Phase 1 decomposes the topic into orthogonal sub-questions with search guidance for each. Phase 2 dispatches **section-researcher** agents (sonnet) in batches of 4–5 — each agent runs 5–7 web searches, fetches top results, curates sources with quality scores, and creates context + source entities. For wiki source mode, **wiki-researcher** agents (sonnet) query cogni-wiki instances using index-first page discovery. For deep reports, **deep-researcher** agents (sonnet) perform recursive tree exploration instead. Phase 3 aggregates all contexts, deduplicates sources, and enforces a 25,000-word context limit. Phase 4 hands the aggregated context to the **writer** agent (sonnet), which produces a structured draft with inline citations. Phase 5 runs a structural-only review (completeness, coherence, source diversity, depth, clarity). Phase 6 copies the accepted draft to `output/report.md`.

**verify-report** then runs in a fresh context window — loading only the draft and source entities, not the research data. It extracts 10–30 verifiable claims from the draft, submits them to cogni-claims for source URL verification, presents results to the user, and runs up to 3 review-revision iterations to fix any factual deviations found. This architectural split ensures claims verification gets full context attention.
